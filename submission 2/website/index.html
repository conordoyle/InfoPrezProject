<h1>Can BlueBike Data Reveal Inefficencies?</h1>

<h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

<p>Understanding the US unemployment rate is crucial for assessing
    the health of the economy and the well-being of its citizens.
    The unemployment rate represents the percentage of people in
    labor force who are actively seeking employment but are unable
    to find jobs. This metric serves as a key indicator of economic
    performance, reflecting the availability of job opportunities
    and the overall level of economic activity. </p>

<p>Monitoring the unemployment rate provides insights into
    various aspects of the economy, such as consumer spending,
    business confidence, and government policies' effectiveness.
    A high unemployment rate may indicate economic downturns,
    leading to decreased consumer spending, reduced business
    investments, and potential social unrest. Conversely,
    a low unemployment rate signifies a robust economy with
    ample job opportunities, contributing to higher consumer
    confidence and economic growth.</p>

<p>Several social factors are closely related to the unemployment
    rate. Persistent unemployment can lead to financial hardships,
    increased poverty rates, and reduced access to essential
    services, such as healthcare and education. Moreover,
    unemployment may exacerbate existing social inequalities,
    disproportionately affecting marginalized communities,
    including minorities, youth, and individuals with lower
    educational attainment.</p>

<p>To learn more about the US unemployment rate and its implications,
    you can visit the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics website</a> or explore
    analysis reports from reputable research organizations like
    <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research Center</a>.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

<p> Our analysis makes use of two datasets. the first data is
    a data set called `us_statewide_crime.csv` which contains
    the following crime statistics for all US states and the
    District of Columbia in 2010. The data has 50 rows with 9
    features. The detail information about the features are listed
    in the following table:</p>

<div class="center">
    <table class="tg">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="tg-0lax">Variable Name</th>
            <th class="tg-0lax">Details</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">State</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">State name</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Violent_Crime</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Violent crime rate (per 100,000 residents)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Murder_Rate</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Murder rate (per 100,000 residents)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Poverty</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents below the poverty rate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">High_School</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents with a high school degree</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">College</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents with a four-year college degree</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Single_Parent</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of children living in single parent families</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Unemployed</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Unemployment rate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Metropolitan</td>
            <td class="tg-0lax">Percent of residents living in a metropolitan area</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

<p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical
    information is important when evaluating the unemployment
    rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information
    on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>.
    The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states.
</p>

<p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
    from the data. Following is an interactive map for the
    lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
    indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any
    state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

</div>

<p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher
    unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia
    and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
    than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
    are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.

<h3>Understanding Popular BlueBike Routes</h3>

<div class='container'>
    <div class='image'>
        <!-- <iframe src="static_plots/index.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->
        <img src="static_plots/sankey_diagram.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
    </div>
    <div class='text'>
        <p> Once we collected and pre-processed our data, our group decided to make a static Sankey visualization to get
            a better understanding of popular BlueBike routes. We picked Sankey because a viewer can easily discern the
            two stations that the visualized routes run between. In addition, each connection looks like a route, with
            the start station, end station, and a thickness of the connection determining the popularity. We can see
            from this diagram that the most popular BlueBike route is between Central Square at Mass Ave/Essex St, and
            MIT at Mass Ave/Amherst St. The second most popular route is between MIT Stata Center at Vassar St/Main St
            and MIT Vassar St. The third most popular route is between Central Square at Mass Ave/Essex St and MIT
            Pacific St at Purrington St. We can now follow the logic and hypothesis that we initially set out on: the
            MBTA transit around these popular routes should be investigated and possibly improved, because we determine
            from this Sankey diagram that these are areas with high BlueBike usage, and therefore possibly less transit
            usage.

<h3>Looking at Popular BlueBike Docking Stations</h3>

<div class='container'>
    <div class='text'>
        <p>The bar chart visualizes the most popular BlueBike Stations based on the total number of trips started within
            the time frame. The chart illustrates that the station with the most trips started was at MIT at Mass Ave/
            Amherst Street. Both this station as well as the second most popular station (Central Square at Mass Ave/
            Essex St) both have over 3000 trips started at these locations. The five most popular BlueBike stations have
            over 2,000 trips started. After the initial five stations there is a gradual decline in trips started with
            the final station in the visualization representing 1,000 trips started. Understanding which docking
            stations have the highest count of trips initiated gives us an understanding of potential areas the MBTA can
            improve its overall efficiency.

<p>We have also create an interactive scatter plot so that
    our users can select a couple of states within
    a certain range of unemployment rate and to see how the
    other factors may be related here.

<h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

<p>
    Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
    MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
    such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and
    show the bar plot on each factors.

<h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

<p>
    In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US
    unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
    between unemployment rate and other social factors.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different
    than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate
    may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
    will be more informative.
