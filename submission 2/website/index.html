<h1>Can BlueBike Data Reveal Inefficencies?</h1>

<h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

<p>Exploring the inefficiencies within the MBTA system is a vital step towards enhancing its operations and meeting the
    diverse needs of commuters across MA. Our project focuses on analyzing BlueBike rider trips to reveal which routes
    the MBTA may be lacking in, given the greater frequency in bike trips for those routes. With further insight into
    the frequency and popularity of bike routes, the data can introduce routes that the MBTA can incorporate or focus
    more on. Hence, this analysis can provide valuable insights into potential gaps in the MBTA system, highlighting
    areas where adjustments or enhancements are needed to better serve commuters.
</p>

<p>This investigation can ultimately identify rider patterns as a means to improve local boston transportation.
    Understanding which routes experience higher volumes of bike trips can help pinpoint opportunities for the MBTA to
    optimize its services and improve overall transit efficiency. By addressing inefficiencies within the MBTA system,
    we can work towards creating a more equitable and accessible transportation network that benefits all members of the
    community.
</p>

<p>To supplement our initial idea, we researched some of the possible issues with the MBTA in its current state. We came
    across a number of articles that outlined how the MBTA needs to expand its routes to help out those living in and
    around Boston. This <a
            href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2022/06/the-next-big-dig/fixing-t-is-not-enough-we-need-massive-expansion">article</a>
    from The Boston Globe outlines some of these
    problems, “Fixing the T is not enough. We
    need a massive expansion.”
</p>

<p>Additionally, we wanted to see if there were already any existing relationships between Boston MBTA services and
    BlueBikes. An <a
            href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2023/10/12/wu-announces-program-to-slash-bluebikes-prices-by-more-than-half-for-residents/">article</a>
    from Boston.com outlines both the issues Bostonians are seeing with the MBTA, and how
    BlueBikes have started to provide a solution, “Wu announces program to slash Bluebikes prices by more than half for
    residents.” Using the information from these two articles, we are excited to further explore BlueBike data and see
    how it could reveal any inefficiencies in the current MBTA services.

<h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

<p> Our analysis makes use of two datasets. the first data is
    a data set called `us_statewide_crime.csv` which contains
    the following crime statistics for all US states and the
    District of Columbia in 2010. The data has 50 rows with 9
    features. The detail information about the features are listed
    in the following table:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical
    information is important when evaluating the unemployment
    rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information
    on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>.
    The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states.
</p>

<p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
    from the data. Following is an interactive map for the
    lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
    indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any
    state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

</div>

<p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher
    unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia
    and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
    than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
    are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.

<h3>Understanding Popular BlueBike Routes</h3>

<div class='container'>
    <div class='image'>
        <!-- <iframe src="static_plots/index.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->
        <img src="static_plots/sankey_diagram.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
    </div>
    <div class='text'>
        <p> Once we collected and pre-processed our data, our group decided to make a static Sankey visualization to get
            a better understanding of popular BlueBike routes. We picked Sankey because a viewer can easily discern the
            two stations that the visualized routes run between. In addition, each connection looks like a route, with
            the start station, end station, and a thickness of the connection determining the popularity. We can see
            from this diagram that the most popular BlueBike route is between Central Square at Mass Ave/Essex St, and
            MIT at Mass Ave/Amherst St. The second most popular route is between MIT Stata Center at Vassar St/Main St
            and MIT Vassar St. The third most popular route is between Central Square at Mass Ave/Essex St and MIT
            Pacific St at Purrington St. We can now follow the logic and hypothesis that we initially set out on: the
            MBTA transit around these popular routes should be investigated and possibly improved, because we determine
            from this Sankey diagram that these are areas with high BlueBike usage, and therefore possibly less transit
            usage.

<h3>Looking at Popular BlueBike Docking Stations</h3>

<div class='container'>
    <div class='text'>
        <p>The bar chart visualizes the most popular BlueBike Stations based on the total number of trips started within
            the time frame. The chart illustrates that the station with the most trips started was at MIT at Mass Ave/
            Amherst Street. Both this station as well as the second most popular station (Central Square at Mass Ave/
            Essex St) both have over 3000 trips started at these locations. The five most popular BlueBike stations have
            over 2,000 trips started. After the initial five stations there is a gradual decline in trips started with
            the final station in the visualization representing 1,000 trips started. Understanding which docking
            stations have the highest count of trips initiated gives us an understanding of potential areas the MBTA can
            improve its overall efficiency.

        <img src="static_plots/D3BarChartFinished.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>
    </div>
</div>

<p>We have also create an interactive Altair scatter plot that included the closest MBTA transit stations to the user's
    chosen BlueBike Station. Since this is an Altair plot, users can use their mouse to scroll over the different
    plotted BlueBike stations. Included in each tooltip that pops up is the computed closest MBTA bus station and train
    station. Use your tooltip to hover over the largest circles (the most popular docking stations found in our last
    plot) to see the closest MBTA transit stations.

<h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

<p>
    Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
    MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
    such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and
    show the bar plot on each factors.

<h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

<p>
    In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US
    unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
    between unemployment rate and other social factors.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different
    than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate
    may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
    will be more informative.
